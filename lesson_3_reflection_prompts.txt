When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are workig on another PC or when someone else is contributing to your repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If someone is collaborating to your project and commits any changes you might not want to pull them. It allows you to have more control too.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork -> this is used on GitHub website and systems and it is the term they use for cloning. So it is actually a "clone" but only used in GitHub. You can fork a repository from another user into your collection of repositories in GitHub. Then, you will need to clone if you want that repository to be in your local PC.
	Clone -> used on your PC when you want to copy a repository from the GitHub servers to your local PC.
	Branch -> this refers to a different set of commits inside a repository which split appart one from the other and evolve in parallel along the way. Branches may merge at some point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It is easier to track changes that may be done on the remote stored in GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	It would be much harder in terms of having everything organized. You would need to document all of your changes somehow somewhere to keep track of them. Then, emails or meetings with the rest of the contributors would be needed too in order to put versions together.
