When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are workig on another PC or when someone else is contributing to your repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If someone is collaborating to your project and commits any changes you might not want to pull them. It allows you to have more control too.
