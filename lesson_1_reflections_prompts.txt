How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It points to the lines that are different so it definitely helps with text files that have a lot of lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help when you want to review previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
	docs does?

	It is more flexible.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Depending on the documents that the version control systems work on, it may be more useful to treat each file seperately or together. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log -> shows you the commit IDs of all commits plus a brief comment about what has been changed in that commit.
	git diff -> compares 2 commits and shows you the lines deleted and insterted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	I have seen that it is a powerful tool. Knowing how to use it makes me feel more confident for any changes I will have to do.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to start using it for my own projects and see how it fits with P1.
